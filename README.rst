Performance Python
##################

A performance python example

General
-------
This project is a sample project for presentation at USM in January 2022, providing a minimal environment for trial and testing.

Structure
---------
First of all, the project follows a structured structure with folders and corresponding names.

VCS
---
The entire project is subject to the version control system git, which takes care of the versioning of all files.

Documentation
-------------
The project uses no documentation tool at the moment.

Encapsulation
-------------
The packages are encapsulated or cleanly separated by creating so-called virtual environments.
This means that native libraries are not disturbed and there are fewer dependencies and errors.

Environment
-----------
The project uses the setup tools to make installation and uninstall easy, and to make sharing with other people easy.

Testing
-------
Finally, the project uses unit tests to minimize errors and to simplify refactoring.

Installation
------------

To install with pip, run:

    pip install performance
